8. CLOSED Merge Two Sorted Lists - LeetCode

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.
Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Return the head of the merged linked list.


    Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
    Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
